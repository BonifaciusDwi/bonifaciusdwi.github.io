									<h3>Thesis Project: CSPI in Utrecht</h3>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><iframe position= center; width="100%" height="500px" src="https://itobonifacius.users.earthengine.app/view/thesis" frameborder="2" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></a>

									<p>This thesis explores the Carbon Sequestration Potential Index (CSPI) <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/62622">(Pascual et al., 2021)</a> in rural and urban areas using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study focuses on quantifying carbon sequestration potential, crucial for forest management and conservation in the context of climate change. Through a detailed examination of variables such as Gross Primary Production (GPP), Aboveground Carbon Density (ACD), and Forest Cover (FC), the research investigates their contribution to the CSPI in the Utrecht Province. The map above displays the rural site of the study, Heuvelrug National Park. By switching out the shapefile in the code, the urban area, Utrecht Science Park can be displayed. GPP and ACD can be toggled on or off in the layers tab. This project had a specific aim to generate BSc-level teaching materials using open-source software for students.</p>

									<h3>Kalimantan fire</h3>

									<p>In my remote sensing project, I focused on the Village of Tumbang Nusa, situated within the Kahayan River Basin, using it as a case study mentioned in the book "Environmental Governance in Indonesia" <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15904-6_8">(Nurhidayah et al., 2023)</a>. My primary interest was to explore how fire management, discussed in the book's chapter, could be visually represented through remote sensing. I specifically wanted to investigate the spatial distribution of fires, distinguish between urban and rural areas, and identify agricultural regions. To accomplish this, I utilized a false color layer and obtained data from the Fire Information for Resource Management System. I wanted to see the if there was any correlation between the distribution of fires and the distribution of urban areas, rural areas, and plantations. For the sake of visualisation, I wanted the real time fires to be visible, therefore I set the date of the image collection between 2018 to 2021. I chose the band combination Healthy Vegetation (B8A – B11 – B02). Using the false image layer there are instances where plantations appears to also be where fire hotspots are.</p>

										<h3>Global chloropleth map</h3>

									<p>The chloropleth map displays the annual net change rate of forest areas in 2020, providing data collected by the UN for SDG 15 (Life on Land). Chosen as the deadline for these goals, 2020 revealed that many countries did not achieve their targets. The map uses a diverging texture scale to assess the global situation, highlighting areas of forest area decrease (cross-hatching green) and forest area increase (solid green). It serves as a starting point to evaluate forest conservation efforts and the urgency for action.</p>

										<h3>Web map</h3>

									<iframe position= center; width="100%" height="600px" src="https://uni-utrecht.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e8a312ebbb714a319f83b26bb256a839" frameborder="2" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></a>

									<p>This web app uses the same dataset but allows users to zoom in and out as well as check the percentage value (autovalue3) of individual countries. I used QGIS, a popular open-source GIS software, which allowed me to classify the data into five categories. This classification resulted in a choropleth map with discrete colors representing different data ranges. On the other hand, I also utilized the ArcGIS Online map viewer, which employed a continuous color gradient to represent the data. As a result, the same dataset produced two distinct choropleth maps due to the variation in classification methods. This can be seen most visibly between Canada and the United States between the two maps, with the classified display a greater colour conrtast despite the same value.</p>

									<p>This map is based on the results of data collection via digital data entry tool, with all the points are digitized in the field and can be plotted on a map. The data collected was about water quality, measuring: Ph, Electromagnetic Connectivity, Temperature, Nitrate, Phosphate, and Dissolved Oxygen; along with metadata of date, time, location, and notes.
